1. Introduction
Disease prediction has long been regarded as a critical topic. With big data and Machine Learning growth in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care, and community services.
2. Objective
Build Machine Learning Models to predict the type of Breast Cancer (Malignant or Benign) as well as identify the drivers of cancer.
3. Approach
• Exploring features and Data Preparation which includes missing value treatment and Outlier Detection
• Visualizing relationships among features
• Split the data into train and test data and build sophisticated Machine Learning models
• Evaluating Model performance on test data using Precision, Recall, Accuracy and ROC curve metrics
• Determining the factors driving the cancer.
• Choosing best model based on the accuracy and other measures.
